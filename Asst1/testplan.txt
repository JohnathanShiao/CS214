We tested each individual part of this program before we combined them, making sure to
include edge cases and testing out the warning and error messages that are within.
For decompress, we borrowed the tree from the example and manually wrote some bitstrings.
We would have an example text document that we would then run diff on to make sure that
all the characters were exactly the same, as well as all the delimiters were working properly.
For encoding, it was harder to test, because the only way you could do so was to decode
and hope that it was the same as when you started. If there was any error, it could have been either
decode or encode that had the issue.
